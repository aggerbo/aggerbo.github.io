              <h2>Why?</h2>
              <p>
                We found ourselves scrolling through Twitter, without any real value being created. But we also felt that we would lose out if we cut Twitter completely from our lives. Therefore we wanted to create a really simple app, that does nothing but pulling links from your twitter timeline. Simple? Yes… Effective? Indeed…
              </p>
              <p>
                With “Product name” you get all the latest articles, stories and great medium posts that you would otherwise miss if you weren’t scrolling twitter from top to bottom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consider it a sum up of the day of awesome articles and knowledge.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now we want to be honest with you, this is a sideproject. This is something we create for ourselves but we want to share the app, because we think you could benefit from it too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore we created a small fee to support the evolution of the app and to help pay some of the bills that tags along on the journey. But fear not, we won’t charge you money until we think the app is ready for it, and actually adds value to your everyday life.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are excited to have you on board!

                This is a sideproject, which means we work on this app when time is available during nights and quite times. But that doesn't mean we don't have a roadmap and stuff we want to get done. Here is some of them..

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Filter out sources, maybe you don't wan't a certain kind of stories
                </li>
                <li>
                  Block a user from your timeline

                <li>
                  Peek an article, give me a summary.
